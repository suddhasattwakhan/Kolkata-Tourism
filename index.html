Commissioned in 1943, the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the same location linking the two cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965 it was renamed Rabindra Setu after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and Asian Nobel laureate.[11] It is still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.

          Luchi is a deep-fried flatbread, made of Maida flour, originating from the Bengal region.Luchi is especially popular in the Indian states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura and in the neighbouring country Bangladesh.
               <br>
          It is notably eaten with aloor dum or kosha mangsho. Since Luchi does not involve rice or rice flour, it is a popular staple item at times when rice is to be avoided,as in case of ekadashi, for those who believe in the ritual, or similar instances. In such ritualistic instances, since the primary food needs to be vegetarian, Luchi is preferred with dum aloo or any similar vegetarian dish. In occasions where no such restriction is mandated, luchi and kosha mangsho is often a popular combination.

    <h1>Foodie Bengali!</h1>      
    <p> The cuisine of Bengal is as rich and distinct as the state itself. The rule of Nawabs has deeply influenced Bengali food which is a combination of subtle and fiery flavours. There are certain European influences also like the snack food tradition and foods like chops and cutlets that are British in origin but are prepared and served in most Bengali households.West Bengal is famously known as the land of maach (fish) and bhaat (rice). Bengalis share an irrevocable relationship with these two foods that are a staple in almost every household. Since countless rivers surround the state, fresh sweet water fish are a major attraction with rohu, pabda and koi being the popular ones. Interestingly, there are more than forty types of fresh water fish that are popularly served in Bengal.A much-loved local delicacy in Bengal is an oily fish known as 'Hilsa' or 'Ilish'. The tenderness of the flesh, unique taste and silvery appeal make it the 'queen of fish'. In fact, hilsa holds great cultural importance in Bengal and a pair of hilsa fish (Joda Ilish) is usually bought on auspicious occasions. On the vegetarian platter, one would mostly find tubers, gourds and roots. Vegetables like plantains, potatoes, water lily roots, brinjal and beans dominate the menu.

      Bengali cuisine is a blend of sweet and spicy flavours. The delicate balance between the main ingredients and the seasoning plays a starring role. The simplest of meals gain an exquisite identity on adding 'phoron' or a traditional mix of pungent spices. The 'panch phoron' is used generously and it includes a combination of five spices - cumin, nigella, fenugreek, aniseed and mustard seed.What sets Bengali curries apart are the distinctive flavours of mustard oil, poppy seeds and turmeric with sweet undertones that warm spices like cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and mace impart. Luchi is a deep-fried bread that is preferred here and is prepared using both refined and whole-wheat flour. Mishti Doi, a kind of sweetened yogurt with rich notes of jaggery is a usual accompaniment. All said and done, the robust fish curries and the sinful Bengali sweets easily steal the spotlight.</p>

  <h5>Durga Puja, major festival of Hinduism, traditionally held for 10 days in the month of Ashvina (September–October), the seventh month of the Hindu calendar, and particularly celebrated in Bengal, Assam, and other eastern Indian states. Durga Puja celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the demon king Mahishasura. It begins on the same day as Navratri, a nine-night festival celebrating the divine feminine.
    <br>
    Durga Puja’s first day is Mahalaya, which heralds the advent of the goddess. Celebrations and worship begin on Sasthi, the sixth day. During the following three days, the goddess is worshipped in her various forms as Durga, Lakshmi, and Sarasvati. The celebrations end with Vijaya Dashami (“Tenth Day of Victory” ), when, amid loud chants and drumbeats, idols are carried in huge processions to local rivers, where they are immersed. That custom is symbolic of the departure of the deity to her home and to her husband, Shiva, in the Himalayas. Images of the goddess—astride a lion, attacking the demon king Mahishasura—are placed at various pandals (elaborately decorated bamboo structures and galleries) and temples.
    <br> <br>
    The celebration of this festival is a must watch if you ever plan to visit kolkata. Kolkata is decorated with beautiful lights and the festival is full full of vigour and enthusiazm!!!!

  <h5>Dussehra, also called Dasara or Vijayadashami, in Hinduism, holiday marking the triumph of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, over the 10-headed demon king Ravana, who abducted Rama’s wife, Sita. The festival’s name is derived from the Sanskrit words dasha (“ten”) and hara (“defeat”). Symbolizing the victory of good over evil, Dussehra is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Ashvina (September–October), the seventh month of the Hindu calendar, with the appearance of the full moon, an event called the “bright fortnight” (shukla paksha). Dussehra coincides with the culmination of the nine-day Navratri festival and with the tenth day of the Durga Puja festival. For many, it marks the beginning of preparation for Diwali, which occurs 20 days after Dussehra.
<br> <br>
    Dussehra is celebrated with great fervour and fanfare. In North India, it incorporates Ram Lila, a gala theatrical enactment of Rama’s life story. Effigies of Ravana—often along with those of Meghnada (Ravana’s son) and Kumbhkarana (Ravana’s brother)—are stuffed with firecrackers and set ablaze at night in open fields.</h5>
